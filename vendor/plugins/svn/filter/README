Filter let you specify common filtering options, in order to generate
a filtered condition, useful for filtering from request params.

Example usage:
   filters = Filter.new
   filters.multiple types, :type_id

   people = People.find(:all, :conditions => filters.conditions)
   
   Generates: SELECT * FROM people WHERE (type_id IN (1,2))

   filters.equal type, :type_id
   
   Generates: SELECT * FROM people WHERE (type_id = 1)

Is very beautifull when you whant to add multiple conditions if other (conditions) are verified like:
   
   filters = Filter.new
   filters.great params[:type][:id], :type_id unless params[:type][:id].blank?
   filters.equal params[:model][:id], :model_id unless params[:model][:id].blank?
   
   MyModel.find(:all, :conditions => filters.conditions)
